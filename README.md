✨ Key FeaturesFeatureDescription🔍 RAG SearchSemantic search across your entire codebase before proposing changes.🩺 The Surgeon RuleNever overwrites a file without reading and analyzing it first.✅ Self-HealingRuns integrity checks and auto-fixes compilation errors (up to 3 retries).💾 Safe WritesAutomatic backups before any file modification.🧠 SQLite MemoryRemembers conversation threads and preferences across restarts.🔐 ConfigurationThis agent leverages Google Vertex AI.
